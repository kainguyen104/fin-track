# Final Project Guide

## Overview

Welcome to your final project! You'll have approximately 3.5 weeks to complete this project, which will be developed in three primary phases:

- **Phase 1:** Business Logic + Tests
- **Phase 2:** UI/UX (terminal, web, game interface, etc.)
- **Phase 3:** Data Persistence, Quality Assurance, and Documentation

You will work from the same repository throughout all phases and maintain a weekly changelog.

## Project Requirements

### ðŸ”„ Ongoing

For each phase of the project, you must:

- Make frequent commits and push to GitHub regularly
- Write a weekly changelog in your repository
- Ensure your code is well-documented and tested

### ðŸ’¯ Grading Criteria

Your final project grade carries more weight than any other project in the class. You'll be evaluated on:

**Core Functions**

- Functional and well-organized business logic
- Clear documentation and comprehensive testing
- Evidence of original work

**Professionalism**

- Proactive engagement with TAs and instructor
- Effective use of office hours when needed
- Clear documentation of challenges and solutions

**Weekly Progress**

- Consistent development across all phases
- Regular, meaningful commits
- Avoiding last-minute submissions

**User Experience**

- Interface clarity and ease of use
- Intuitive navigation and functionality
- Error handling and user feedback

**Creativity**

- Implementation of external libraries
- Integration of new technologies
- Creative use of generative AI for enhanced features

## ðŸ“š Support Resources

### Project Repository

A `/resources` folder in your repository will contain:

- Helpful links
- Tutorials
- Additional resources added by instructors throughout the project

### Available Support

- In-class work sessions
- Lab time for project development
- Individual meetings with instructor/TAs
- Discord and email support for questions
- Code review sessions by request

### ðŸ¤– AI Usage Guidelines

You are encouraged to take advantage of generative AIs like ChaptGPT or Claude during your project. However, you must follow these guidelines:

**Permitted:**

- Debugging assistance
- Non-core feature development
- Library integration help
- UI/UX enhancements

**Not Permitted:**

- Core business logic implementation
- Direct code copying
- Test implementation copying

_Important: If you do use AI in your project, be sure to note how and what you used it for in your changelog._

## Important Note

The core business logic must be your original work, as it will be part of your final exam evaluation.
