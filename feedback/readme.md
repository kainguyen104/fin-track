**What you did well:**

- Implemented a wide range of functionalities covering all the primary features you outlined.
- Utilized object-oriented principles to create a modular and maintainable codebase.
- Included data persistence by saving and loading user data to and from a JSON file.
- Handled user inputs and potential errors gracefully within the business logic.

**Areas for improvement:**

- Consider adding more unit tests in `test.py` to cover additional scenarios and edge cases for better code reliability.

### **30**/30
