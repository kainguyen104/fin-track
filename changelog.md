I read all the phase 1 for my project. Moreover, I've set up the core.py and test.py for my project to work correctly.
It would be a foundation for my final project.

## Week 2

**Date:** 11/21/2024

I created more functions for FinTrack to make it more diverse in tools ( calculate: income, balance, expenses; set: savings target, budget target; alert: savings, budget; view: expenses analysis, transactions history; etc.), which can offer more options for users to choose in order to meet their requirements.

## Week 3 - 4

**Date:** 12/05/2024

I am building the code for most of the functions in core.py in order to work logically(fix user's input error). Moreover, greeting and user's information are also added to my program.
